Project: Cloud-Native Monitoring Application Deployment on Kubernetes

Developed a monitoring application using Python (Flask and Psutil) to track system metrics.
Containerized the application by creating a Dockerfile and building Docker images.
Managed Docker images by creating an Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry) repository using Python Boto3 and pushed images to ECR.
Provisioned an EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) cluster and nodes to host the application.
Deployed the application on Kubernetes using Kubernetes Python Client to create deployments and services.
Implemented port forwarding to access the app running on Kubernetes pods.
Demonstrated expertise in CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS throughout the project.
